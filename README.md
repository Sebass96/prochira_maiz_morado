## Abstract

Maize (*Zea mays* L.) is the worldâ€™s third most important cereal crop.
Purple maize is an exportable agricultural product due to its high
anthocyanin content. This crop is directly sown in the field, where seed
germination determines the density of established plants, which directly
impacts yield. This research was conducted under controlled laboratory
and greenhouse conditions. The genetic material used included seeds of
native purple maize and the hybrid PMV 581. The experiment was set up
under a completely randomized design with three replications. The effect
of three stimulants, milk whey, sulfur dioxide, and seaweed was
evaluated on germination and early development. The results demonstrated
that the application of stimulants positively affected the germination
percentage and seedling development indicators. Compared with the
control, the seaweed-based treatments at both doses (1 and 1.5 L/200 L)
resulted in greater values for the following variables: number of roots,
plant height, stem thickness, leaf width, thickness, and length, and dry
weight of the shoots. This finding indicates that its application as a
pre-germination treatment promotes root and shoot development in maize
seedlings at early growth stages.
